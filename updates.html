                      <p>
                        This past week Innovire celebrated its 4th anniversary - 
                        and what an incredible journey it’s been!! It all started 
                        off in 2018, hosting our first Innovire Summit in a small 
                        school gym, and now it’s grown to be so much more. We are 
                        so incredibly grateful to you all for being a part of our 
                        community and helping to make Innovire what it is today. 
                        <br>
                        <br>As Innovire has grown over the years - with various initiatives, 
                        campaigns and programs - we have been able to connect with, 
                        impact and inspire 700+ youth. We are proud of all the work 
                        we have done so far and cognisant of all the challenges that
                        we have overcome in the last few years. The last year has been 
                        full of highs and lows - experiencing mixtures of success, doubt 
                        and failures as we further navigated the virtual world. 
                        However, our team has remained motivated to continue to 
                        bring forward unique, creative and innovative initiatives
                        that inspire youth to innovate. As we start to incorporate
                        in-person events back into our programs we look forward to 
                        implementing new ways to build, interact and connect with our 
                        community to not only provide them with the best opportunities 
                        for success, but to build meaningful connections.
                        <br>
                        <br>As we celebrate 4 years, we are also incredibly appreciative 
                        of everyone who has guided and supported us through this 
                        journey - specifically our mentors, sponsors, partners 
                        and guest presenters. Thank you to our mentors: Mrs. Darroch, 
                        Mrs. Jackson, Mr. Jansma, Mrs. Perez and the rest of the

                        would not have been where it is today without your support, 
                        time, dedication and willingness to share your wisdom, 
                        experience and knowledge.
                        <br>
                        <br>We’d also like to thank the hundreds of individuals within 
                        our community who have supported us by participating in our 
                        initiatives and campaigns. We love engaging with our community
                        and are amazed by how much it has grown and developed over 
                        the years. Our community is made up of youth with a wide 
                        range of talent, passions and aspirations and we hope to 
                        continue to inspire youth to innovate solutions to 
                        problems faced by our world.
                        <br>
                        <br>As Innovire rounds off its 4th year and moves towards its 5th, 
                        we reflect on all that we have accomplished already with pride 
                        and gratitude and look ahead with determination - inspired to 
                        continue working towards fulfilling our vision.

                      <h3 class="title">Our Take On Inequality</h3>
                      <p>
                        We stand against racism and inequality, and as an
                        organization meant to inspire students to innovate, we
                        do NOT condone any form of racial bias or
                        discrimination. We encourage you all to educate
                        yourselves and acknowledge the privilege you might have.
                        It is essential to create a more inclusive and accepting
                        community for everyone.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The injustices happening globally have brought many
                        disturbing issues to light, they are disgraceful and it
                        is our (and your) responsibility to change that. We
                        support you and all those who have been impacted by
                        these injustices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We at the Innovire Team would like to inform our
                        audiences of ways that you can inform yourself and help
                        support these causes. For a list of petitions and
                        various sources regarding these movements, we have
                        created an organized list, and we highly suggest you
