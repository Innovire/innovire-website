                      <p>
                        In May Innovire celebrated its third anniversary and it’s
                        been an amazing journey so far. Innovire has grown so much 
                        since it began in 2018, and our team has been able to 
                        impact and connect with 600+ youth. The last year and a 
                        half has been a roller coaster ride filled with doubts and 
                        uncertainties but through it all we persevered and put 
                        forward initiatives to inspire youth to innovate and give 
                        them access to the resources, skills, experiences and 
                        knowledge they’d need to do so. While moving to a virtual 
                        setting has made it difficult to build and interact with 
                        our community,  genuine passion for inspiring youth, 
                        creativity, innovation, and perseverance allowed our team 
                        to continue providing valuable opportunities for youth in 
                        our community.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The entire journey has truly been a dream come true, and 
                        none of it would have been possible without everyone who 
                        has supported us and helped us get this far. I’d like to 
                        thank everyone who has contributed to our journey. Thank you 
                        to our mentors - Mrs. Darroch, Mrs. Jackson, Mr. Jansma,

                        Most of all I’d like to thank each and every person who has 
                        participated in our initiatives and make them all so successful. 
                        The Innovire Community has grown so much and is made up of 
                        youth with a wide range of talent, passions and aspirations. 
                        We truly hope we can continue to inspire youth to innovate 
                        solutions to problems faced by our world and build a 
                        community of innovators and change-makers.
                      </p>

                        As Innovire gears up for its 4th year, we continue to reflect 
                        on what we’ve done so far and how much more we still have to go. 
                        We look forward to continuing our work to achieve our vision! 
                        We will be opening up applications for new members soon, 
                        so stay tuned!!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As we are in the midst of a pandemic, this past year and
                        in the year going forward we have been trying to adapt
                        to the situation. In doing so, we had to put a pause on
                        our yearly in person Innovire Summit but we have come up
                        with various plans and initiatives that will help us to
                        build our brand awareness and see through our dream of
                        inspiring youth to innovate using technology.

                      <p>
                        We stand against racism and inequality, and as an
                        organization meant to inspire students to innovate, we
                        do NOT condone any form of racial bias or
                        discrimination. We encourage you all to educate
                        yourselves and acknowledge the privilege you might have.
                        It is essential to create a more inclusive and accepting
                        community for everyone.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The injustices happening globally have brought many
                        disturbing issues to light, they are disgraceful and it
                        is our (and your) responsibility to change that. We
                        support you and all those who have been impacted by
                        these injustices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We at the Innovire Team would like to inform our
                        audiences of ways that you can inform yourself and help
                        support these causes. For a list of petitions and
                        various sources regarding these movements, we have
                        created an organized list, and we highly suggest you
                        check all of these links out:
